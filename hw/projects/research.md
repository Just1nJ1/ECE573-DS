# Project Research Instructions

1. Create a private repo and share with the TA and me.
    - Create a directory structure
      - src (code goes in this)
      - doc (your documentation goes in here, including abstract.pdf)
      - diagrams (any diagrams that clarify your project)
      - ref (articles you research and download go here)
1. Select one of the predefined topics, or propose your own. If you wish to pick your own topic, you must write a proposal, less than one page describing what you want to achieve, and show a search showing that you have done the preliminary work to find papers as described below. If you have an idea that has merit, it must be submitted early so I can verify. If you receive approval from me in writing and are assigned the topic, you may proceed.
1. For your topic, determine a list of keywords and search on google scholar
    - Example, for finding papers on Tries
    - scholar: trie compression
    - The initial set of keywords may be too broad, you may need to refine it. You will improve your search by visiting with the librarian.
1. Store your keywords in a file keywords.txt
1. Create a file refs.bib where you will store the references you find.
1. Make an appointment with the librarian
    - [Courtney Walsh or Victoria Orlofsky](https://libanswers.stevens.edu/ask)
    - The librarian will give you better ways to refine your search
    - Look for survey papers on your topic which will tend to be easier to read and good summaries of all the research that's been done
    - Find the most-cited papers in the area
    - Bear in mind that the most recent articles may not have accumulated citations, so the total number of citations is not the only criteria
    - Add the citations you find into refs.bib in [LaTeX bib format](https://latex-tutorial.com/tutorials/bibtex/)
1. Write an abstract describing the problem. The abstract should not mention you, and should start by describing the problem and mentioning the key research that has been done
1. Your research will be scored according to the following criteria
    - Good set of keywords, effort put in
    - Librarian's review of the work you did on the search
    - List of papers, downloaded and stored into ref
    - You identified papers that are relevant to your area of research, or make a claim that there are no papers on your area.
    - Write an abstract describing your project 250 words or less.
1. Your project will be scored as follows
   - 20% research on what has been done in this area
   - 40% implementation of your algorithm
     - 50% Code working, reasonable effort to implement an efficient algorithm. Note that if your problem is extremely hard, some latitude may be given, but you are expected to try, and no mercy will be given if we do not see regular, consistent work submitted into the repo. The way we measure how hard you try is by the work you check into the repo. This means that you *must* check in every week for the duration of the project in order to show that you are steadily trying to work. Don't try to do it all the last night, you will fail. 
     - 30% Code is clearly documented. Alternative: you can write a theoretical paper if writing code in the area is completely beyond you, or if your idea is very theoretical. You must get approval to do this in advance, and if so your work with diagrams and thoughts must be regularly pushed into the repository to show the work you did over time.
   - 20% analysis of your algorithm.
   - 20% Carefully done, clean diagrams, preferably generated in google diagrams or equivalent, showing your idea.
